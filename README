Goal: Create a shell and accessories, primarily for the web.
The shell will provide an interface for performing basic web
tasks. Each 'accessory' program will handle a single web task
and do it well. The shell will provide means of combination
of these tasks, and will integrate seamlessly into a regular
system shell. A mix between a system shell and a Yahoo Pipes
command-line interface.

Currently the most basic system shell has been implemented,
primarily to understand functioning, later on an existing
shell may be extended to provide web accessories.
